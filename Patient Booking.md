We are building a React Native mobile app that connects patients with health or wellness practitioners. The app includes features like subscriptions, booking, session history, secure messaging, assessments, and video calls.

We're looking for a skilled full-stack developer or a team experienced in React Native and building secure REST APIs to bring this app to life.

Designs will be provided later, but the full scope and requirements are already defined.
